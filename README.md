Results-Scrapper
================

this is a simple python script that i had written a few days back that logs into my college's (NIT TRICHY) results page and automatically gathers result data (gpa , name and roll number) and saves the information in a file on your harddrive . I've included another file which reads this file in your harddrive and calculates your rank and displays a graph showing the plot of gpa vs rollnumber .
